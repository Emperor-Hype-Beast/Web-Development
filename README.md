To create and run a website on your Android device using Termux, start by installing the Termux application from the F-Droid store, as the Play Store version is outdated.
Once installed, open Termux and update its packages by running pkg update && pkg upgrade. Next, install the necessary extensions like PHP (to serve your website locally) by executing pkg install php.

You may also install Apache2 using pkg install apache2 for an alternative web server setup.
Create your project directory and files (e.g., index.html and styles.css) inside the Termux environment.
To serve your website, navigate to the project folder using cd /path/to/project and start PHP's built-in server with php -S localhost:8080.
Open a web browser on your device and access the website at http://localhost:8080. Optionally, you can install a text editor like vim or nano for editing your code directly in Termux, and Git to manage version control and upload your project to GitHub.
With Termux and the extensions set up, you have a lightweight development environment for learning and building web applications on the go.
